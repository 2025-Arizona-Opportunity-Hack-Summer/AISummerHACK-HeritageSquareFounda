    ## Project Overview
    # Project description
    1. Problem: Heritage Square's unorganized Google Drive hinders efficient document retrieval for marketing, operations, and grants, while manual AI prompting is time-consuming and potentially inaccurate.
    2. Key Features: Implement AI-driven document categorization, suggest reorganization strategies, automate file movement, and integrate with existing AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT or Gemini) for enhanced prompting capabilities.
    
    ## Goal
    Develop an AI agent with access to Heritage Square's Google Drive to assist in document organization, tagging, and retrieval, as well as provide accurate responses to staff queries.

    ## Tech Stack
    - Frontend: 
    - Backend:
